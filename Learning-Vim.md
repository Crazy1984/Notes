# Learning Vim

I have just started using Vim for writing small scripts while doing CTFs so this will have things that I am learning with time.

* duplicate a line: `:t.`
* Copy paste are simple:
    - `Shift+CTRL+C` - copy
    - `Shift+CTRL+V` - paste
* quit
    - `:qa!`

* visual mode:
    - Press `v` to get into visual mode
    - Use arrow keys to select the text.
    - d - delete
    - p - paste
    - u - undo
* :s/,/\r/g
    - Break on comma

* :set number
    - Show line number
