# Notes

These are my notes on anything and everything I learn. These mostly contains information about Capture The Flag(CTF) and Boot2Root CTFs.
Also I've added some information if you want to get started in making the boot2root VMs/CTFs.

If you are looking for the source of these notes, you can find that [here](https://github.com/mzfr/Notes).
