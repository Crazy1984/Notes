# Notes

I've been playing lots of CTFs lately and there's lot to learn in them and some times the challenges are either repeated or are of similar type so it's better to keep a record of them. So I started making CTF notes.

Then after sometime I started doing [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/), [wizardlabs](https://labs.wizard-security.net/) etc to get a good understanding of `Pentesting` or maybe I am just doing it for fun :smile: With all this going on it's always good to keep notes so I don't spend hours googling the same thing.

With that intention I first decided to just put them in one of my github repository but then I decided to use what the `cool` people are using so here I am on GitBook

Obviously this idea of keeping notes were taken after I found out how other people maintain their so called `idea` or `learning` Notes.

Some good list to check out are:
