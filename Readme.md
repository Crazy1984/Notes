# Notes

I've been playing lots of CTFs lately and there's lot to learn in them and some times the challenges are either repeated or are of similar type so it's better to keep a record of them. So I started making CTF notes.

Then after sometime I started doing [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/), [wizardlabs](https://labs.wizard-security.net/) etc to get a good understanding of `Pentesting` or maybe I am just doing it for fun :smile:
