# Basic pentesting

I am not a professional pentester or something these are just the things that I have learned while doing Vulnerable VMs from websites like [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/), [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/), [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) etc.

### General

* If you have downloaded the VM from Website like Vulnhub or any other website then make sure you run it in `host-only` mode. Even though Vulnhub can be super trusted but still it's good to be paranoid.
    - Most of the VM with `bridged` as their default network setting.
    - Also if you want to be super paranoid then go for NAT setting but I've had issues with some VMs in `NAT` network setting.

* Enumeration is the Key but only till a certain level. Lot of times the way is too guessy, too CTF type and that point `enumeration` doesn't help at all. So if you have done the basics of enumeration like for HTTP service fuzzing, dirsearch etc then don't worry it's totally okay to ask for a damn hint.

* Always take a good look of what you've found
* php file type can be bypassed by php5
* If in a file upload the output is shown meaning it's processing the upload
    - exploit it with command injection in filename like "shell.txt;id"
* Change Static IP
    - `sudo ifconfig vmnet1 10.10.10.11 netmask 255.255.255.0`
* VMware /dev/vmmon not loaded
    - `sudo vmware-modconfig --console --install-all`

* `sudo vmware-modconfig --console --install-all`
    - Fix the issue of vmware modprobe error

* If cracking password for kdbx takes longer time then try finding a key file for it.
* For git repos always check out the git logs
* If for some reason dirsearch or gobuster doesn't work on any URL or if they show every URL as the right try to use wfuzz
    - `wfuzz -c -w wordlist --hw 12 --hc 400 URL`
