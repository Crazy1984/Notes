# Making a boot2root machine/VM

* Use Fixed memory allocation since that is much faster
* Assign 1 GB RAM first and then test the VM if it's slow or something then extend the RAM .
    - This helps to test VM on low specs. We might have 8/16GB ram but the person doing might not have that.
* For ubuntu always use the `server` version and not the GUI/full ISO
    - http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/
* For debian
* For supervisor when you want to autostart some service on boot

```
[program:name]
directory=/opt/1337
command=flask run --port 1337
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stopsignal=INT
stopasgroup=true
killasgroup=true
```

Then restart the `supervisor` service
```bash
sudo systemctl restart supervisor.service
```

And then you can check if the service is running by executing
```
supervisorctl status
```

You should see the new app.

Sometime we end up getting error like
```
unix:\\\var\run\supervisor.sock no such file
```

or

```
error: <class socket.sock>..........
```

So the fix that seemed to work for me was to run `echo_supervisord_conf > /etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf `

and then reread the config with

```
supervisorctl -c /etc/supervisord/supervisord.conf reread
```

and then we should see all the services running.
