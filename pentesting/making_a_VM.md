# Making a boot2root machine/VM

## Misc

* To make your own man page

```bash
$ cp nuseradd /usr/local/man/man8/nuseradd.8
$ gzip /usr/local/man/man8/nuseradd.8
$ man nuseradd
```

* Portknocking

* Use Fixed memory allocation since that is much faster
* Assign 1 GB RAM first and then test the VM if it's slow or something then extend the RAM .
    - This helps to test VM on low specs. We might have 8/16GB ram but the person doing might not have that.
* For ubuntu always use the `server` version and not the GUI/full ISO
    - http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/
* For debian

## Supervisor - Systemd

### It's better to use normal systemd rather then putting your head under this supervisor

* For supervisor when you want to autostart some service on boot

https://gist.github.com/mozillazg/6cbdcccbf46fe96a4edd

```
[program:name]
directory=/opt/1337
command=flask run --port 1337
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stopsignal=INT
stopasgroup=true
killasgroup=true
```

Then restart the `supervisor` service
```bash
sudo systemctl restart supervisor.service
```

And then you can check if the service is running by executing
```
supervisorctl status
```

You should see the new app.

Sometime we end up getting error like
```
unix:\\\var\run\supervisor.sock no such file
```

or

```
error: <class socket.sock>..........
```

So the fix that seemed to work for me was to run `echo_supervisord_conf > /etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf `

and then reread the config with

```
supervisorctl -c /etc/supervisord/supervisord.conf reread
```

and then we should see all the services running.

* Instead of using supervisord prefer going directly for systemd.

## Xinetd

* If you want to run a script with which a person can interact then use `xinted`
    - https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-how-do-i-configure-xinetd-service/
    - Sometimes when you start the xinetd service you might get error about `no service game/tcp` etc if this is the case just open `/etc/services` and add your service name with the port you are running it on.
    ```
    game        1337/tcp        #this is a game
    ```

## Python script to binary

* You can use `cython` or `nuitka` to compile python script to an elf.
    - nuitka does everything for you.
    - If using `cython` then do the following:
        * `cython file.py --embed`
            - use `-3` or `-2` to use python versions
        * `gcc -Os -I /usr/include/python3.5m -o file file.c -lpython3.5m -lpthread -lm -lutil -ldl`

## Fixing interface name

* When we need to fix the damn interface name so dynamic dhcp is working
